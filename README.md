# CryptoCurrencyTestProject
I have implemented the TOP-10 cryptocurrencies returned by the API, as well as a table with a list of all cryptocurrencies and specific data about them. There is an option to double-click on a row in the table to view detailed information about the corresponding cryptocurrency. As for additional features, I have implemented a currency converter and the ability to switch between dark and light themes. I used the MVVM architecture with the DevExpressMvvm framework, the Fody helper library, Newtonsoft.Json for working with JSON, and the standard HttpClient for parsing the API.
I would also like to mention that when the program starts, data is loaded from the API, so it takes about 30-40 seconds to load completely, as some requests are made up to 20 times to retrieve all the data about the cryptocurrencies. Additionally, I lost access to my GitHub account due to a hacked email, so I wonâ€™t be able to show the commit history on GitHub, as I had to move the project to this new account.
